<h2>Introduction of Cybercrime</h2><br>
<p>Cybercrime is the activity of using computers and networks to perform illegal activities like spreading computer viruses, online bullying, performing unauthorized electronic fund transfers, etc. Most cybercrime hacks are committed through the internet, and some cybercrimes are performed using Mobile phones via SMS and online chatting applications.</p>
<br>

<li><h3>Sharing copyrighted files/information</h3></li><br>
<p>This involves distributing copyright protected files such as eBooks and computer programs etc.</P><br>
<li><h3>Electronic funds transfer</h3></li><br>
<p>This involves the use of the computer to launder money.</P><br>
<li><h3>ATM Fraud</h3></li><br>
<p>This involves intercepting ATM card details such as account number and PIN numbers. These details are then used to withdraw funds from the intercepted accounts.</P><br>
<li><h3>Denial of Service Attacks</h3></li><br>

 <h2> Most cybercrime falls under two main categories:</h2><br>
<p>
Criminal activity that targets
Criminal activity that uses computers to commit other crimes.
Cybercrime that targets computers often involves viruses and other types of malware.

Cybercriminals may infect computers with viruses and malware to damage devices or stop them working. They may also use malware to delete or steal data.</p><br>

<p>
Cybercrime that stops users using a machine or network, or prevents a business providing a software service to its customers, is called a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
<br><br>
Cybercrime that uses computers to commit other crimes may involve using computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information or illegal images.
<br><br>
Sometimes cybercriminals conduct both categories of cybercrime at once. They may target computers with viruses first. Then, use them to spread malware to other machines or throughout a network.
<br><br>
Cybercriminals may also carry out what is known as a Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDos) attack. This is similar to a DoS attack but cybercriminals use numerous compromised computers to carry it out.
<br><br>
The US Department of Justice recognizes a third category of cybercrime which is where a computer is used as an accessory to crime. An example of this is using a computer to store stolen data.
<br><br>
The US has signed the European Convention of Cybercrime. The convention casts a wide net and there are numerous malicious computer-related crimes which it considers cybercrime. For example:
 
</p><br>

<ull><h3 class = "center">
<li>Illegally intercepting or stealing data.</li>
<li>Interfering with systems in a way that compromises a network.</li>
<li>Infringing copyright.</li>
<li>Illegal gambling.</li>
<li>Selling illegal items online.</li>
<li>Soliciting, producing or possessing child pornography.</li>
</h3>
</ull> 

<h2> Examples of cybercrime</h2><br>

<p><font color ="blue" face = " Algerian" >So, what exactly counts as cybercrime? And are there any well-known examples?</font></p>
<p><br>
In this section, we look at famous examples of different types of cybercrime attack used by cybercriminals. Read on to understand what counts as cybercrime.
 </p><br>

<h2 class = "center" ><font color = "#ffc65c">Malware attacks</h2><br>
<p>

A malware attack is where a computer system or network is infected with a computer virus or other type of malware.<br>

A computer compromised by malware could be used by cybercriminals for several purposes. These include stealing confidential data, using the computer to carry out other criminal acts, or causing damage to data.<br><br>

A famous example of a malware attack is the WannaCry ransomware attack, a global cybercrime committed in May 2017.<br>

Ransomware is a type of malware used to extort money by holding the victim’s data or device to ransom. WannaCry is type of ransomware which targeted a vulnerability in computers running Microsoft Windows.<br><br>

When the WannaCry ransomware attack hit, 230,000 computers were affected across 150 countries. Users were locked out of their files and sent a message demanding that they pay a BitCoin ransom to regain access.<br>

Worldwide, the WannaCry cybercrime is estimated to have caused $4 billion in financial losses.

</p><br>

<h2 class = "center" ><font color = "#ffc65c">Phishing</h2><br>
<p>
A phishing campaign is when spam emails, or other forms of communication, are sent en masse, with the intention of tricking recipients into doing something that undermines their security or the security of the organization they work for.<br><br>

Phishing campaign messages may contain infected attachments or  links to malicious sites. Or they may ask the receiver to respond with confidential information<br>

A famous example of a phishing scam from 2018 was one which took place over the World Cup. According to reports by Inc, the World Cup phishing scam involved emails that were sent to football fans.<br><br>

These spam emails tried to entice fans with fake free trips to Moscow, where the World Cup was being hosted. People who opened and clicked on the links contained in these emails had their personal data stolen. <br>
</p>
<p>
Another type of phishing campaign is known as spear-phishing. These are targeted phishing campaigns which try to trick specific individuals into jeopardizing the security of the organization they work for. <br><br>

Unlike mass phishing campaigns, which are very general in style, spear-phishing messages are typically crafted to look like messages from a trusted source. For example, they are made to look like they have come from the CEO or the IT manager. They may not contain any visual clues that they are fake.</p>

<h2 class = "center" ><font color ="#ffc65c">Distributed DoS attacks </font> </h2><br>

<p>
Distributed DoS attacks (DDoS) are a type of cybercrime attack that cybercriminals use to bring down a system or network. Sometimes connected IoT (internet of things) devices are used to launch DDoS attacks.<br>

A DDoS attack overwhelms a system by using one of the standard communication protocols it uses to spam the system with connection requests.<br>

Cybercriminals who are carrying out cyberextortion may use the threat of a DDoS attack to demand money. Alternatively, a DDoS may be used as a distraction tactic while other type of cybercrime takes place.<br>

A famous example of this type of attack is the 2017 DDoS attack on the UK National Lottery website. This brought the lottery’s website and mobile app offline, preventing UK citizens from playing.

How to protect yourself against cybercrime</i></font></h1><br>


<p>
So, now you understand the threat cybercrime represents, what are the best ways to protect your computer and your personal data? Here are our top tips:<br>
<br>
<h2>Keep software and operating system updated</h2><br>
<p>
Keeping your software and operating system up to date ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches to protect your computer.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Use anti-virus software and keep it updated</h2><br>
<p>
Using anti-virus or a comprehensive internet security solution like Kaspersky Total Security is a smart way to protect your system from attacks.<br>
<br>
Anti-virus software allows you to scan, detect and remove threats before they become a problem. Having this protection in place helps to protect your computer and your data from cybercrime, giving you piece of mind.<br>

If you use anti-virus software, make sure you keep it updated to get the best level of protection.
</p><br><br>
<h2>Use strong passwords</h2><br>

<p>
Be sure to use strong passwords that people will not guess and do not record them anywhere. Or use a reputable password manager to generate strong passwords randomly to make this easier.<br><br>

</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Never open attachments in spam emails</h2><br>
<p>
A classic way that computers get infected by malware attacks and other forms of cybercrime is via email attachments in spam emails. Never open an attachment from a sender you do not know.
</p><br><br>


<div style="text-align: center;"><img src = "gmail.jpg" width=30% height=20% alt = "Ecm "></div><br>

<h2>Do not click on links in spam emails or untrusted websites</h2><br>
<p>
Another way people become victims of cybercrime is by clicking on links in spam emails or other messages, or unfamiliar websites. Avoid doing this to stay safe online.<br><br></p>

<h2>Do not give out personal information unless secure</h2><br>
<p>
Never give out personal data over the phone or via email unless you are completely sure the line or email is secure. Make certain that you are speaking to the person you think you are. 
</p><br><br>
<h2>Contact companies directly about suspicious requests</h2><br>
<p>
If you get asked for data from a company who has called you, hang up. Call them back using the number on their official website to ensure you are speaking to them and not a cybercriminal. 
<br>

Ideally, use a different phone because cybercriminals can hold the line open. When you think you’ve re-dialed, they can pretend to be from the bank or other organization that you think you’re speaking to.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Be mindful of which website URLs you visit</h2><br>
<p>
Keep an eye on the URLs you are clicking on. Do they look legitimate? Avoid clicking on links with unfamiliar or spammy looking URLs.<br>

If your internet security product includes functionality to secure online transactions, ensure it is enabled before carrying out financial transactions online.
</p><br><br>

<h2>Keep an eye on your bank statements</h2><br>
<p>
Our tips should help you avoid falling foul of cybercrime. However, if all else fails, spotting that you have become a victim of cybercrime quickly is important.
</p><br>
<p>
Keep an eye on your bank statements and query any unfamiliar transactions with the bank. The bank can investigate whether they are fraudulent.
</p><br>
<p>Now you understand the threat of cybercrime, protect yourself from it.
